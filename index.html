      <h3>Physical therapist going to be software developer</h3>
      <p>
        I came into the contact with some kind of programming during my teen-age. I created my first website about my
        favourite game, it was hard becaouse I had to learn all by myself and I did not know that something like CSS
        existed. So every tag and HTML element was styled by inline styling within the code. It became real mess pretty
        soon, but it
        worked and I loved it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to continue my journey right where it has ended and finally become great software engineer thanks
        to
        your course and given opportunity.
